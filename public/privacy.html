  <h1>Privacy Policy for Delible Ink.</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 1st January 2024</p>

  <p>Thank you for using Delible Ink. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Usage:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We store hashed text in your device's local storage when you write. No
      personal information is collected or transmitted to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The hashed text stored in local storage is automatically erased every night at midnight. This is necessary for
      the app to function as designed and ensures user privacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Delible ink is completely private by design and doesn't share any data with the rest of the web.</li>
    <li>The application runs on your device alone and doesn't send any data back to a server. Your text is kept until midnight in localStorage, which lives on your device</li>
    <li>There is a basic form of encryption to ensure the stored text is hashed until you personally open Delible Ink.<li>
    <li>Instances where someone else might be able to view what you write include:
      <ol>
        <li>If you share a device with someone but don't use individual system logins or browser profiles.</li>
        <li>Certain system add-ons, browser extensions etc. may be able to read what's rendered on your screen. You should consult their own privacy policies in this instance.</li>
        <li>In the highly unlikely event that someone has gained access to storage files on your device, reverse-engineered Delible Ink's encryption and used browser-specific technology to decode localStorage.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Server Interaction:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Our app, hosted on Kinsta's static site service, does not send any data back to our servers. The app operates
      independently on your device, minimising external interactions after initially loading.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cache and Loading Times:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>To enhance your experience, our app is cached on your device during installation. This minimises loading times
      and ensures a smoother user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We do not use any third-party services for data collection or processing. Your information is solely handled
      within the confines of your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</h2>

  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective
    date.</p>

  <p>By using Delible Ink., you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or
    concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@delible.ink">help@delible.ink</a></p>

  <p>Thank you for trusting us with your data privacy.</p>
