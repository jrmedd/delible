## About üß†

My therapist recently asked me to start writing things down. The purpose of this writing isn't to record anything, just to get it out of my brain. Doing this repeatedly helps me to get things straight, and form positive mental pathways for things that I don't do habitually. I don't like to waste paper, so I created [Delible ink](https://delible.ink).

Unlike indelible ink, this ink won't last longer than a day. Anything you type into it is totally private and disappears completely at midnight. It's minimal and unobtrusive, so I can focus on getting my thoughts down without too much distraction. 

If you think it might help you out, try it out https://delible.ink

## Safety üîè

Delible ink is **completely private** by default and doesn't share any data with the rest of the web. Instances where someone else might be able to view what you write include:

1. If you share a web browser with someone but don't use individual system logins or [browser profiles](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-browser-profiles-organization-chrome-edge-firefox/).
