## About üß†

My therapist recently asked me to start writing things down. The purpose of this writing isn't to record anything, just to get it out of my brain. Doing this repeatedly helps me to get things straight, and form positive mental pathways for things that I don't do habitually. I don't like to waste paper, so I created [Delible ink](https://delible.ink).

Unlike indelible ink, this ink won't last longer than a day. Anything you type into it is totally private and disappears completely at midnight. It's minimal and unobtrusive, so I can focus on getting my thoughts down without too much distraction. 

If you think it might help you out, try it out https://delible.ink

## Safety üîè

Delible ink is **completely private** by design and doesn't share any data with the rest of the web. The application runs in your browser alone and **doesn't send any data back to a server**. Your text is kept until midnight in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API), which means it is stored by the browser. There is a basic form of encryption to ensure the stored text is garbled until you personally open Delible Ink. Instances where someone else might be able to view what you write include:

1. If you share a web browser with someone but don't use individual system logins or [browser profiles](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-browser-profiles-organization-chrome-edge-firefox/).
2. If you have an extension installed that can read and manage data on a web page. You can [control this in settings on Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en-GB) if you are concerned about a particular extension. You can find similar instructions for other browsers with a quick search of your browser name and privacy / extension settings.
3. In the highly unlikely event that someone has gained access to your browser's storage files on your machine, installed specialised viewing software to open the browser's storage formats, and decrypted the data stored within it by reverse-engineering Delible Ink.
